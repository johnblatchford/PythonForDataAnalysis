   HW assignment 2
1. Include a section with your name
2. Create matrix A with size (3,5) containing random numbers A = np.random.random(15)
3. Find the size and length of matrix A
4. Resize (crop/slice) matrix A to size (3,4)
5. Find the transpose of matrix A and assign it to B
6. Find the minimum value in column 1 of matrix B (check the properties of a matrix – ‘B.min()’)
7. Find the minimum and maximum values for the entire matrix A
8. Create vector X (an array) with 4 random numbers
9. Create a function and pass vector X and matrix A in it
10. In the new function multiply vector X with matrix A and assign the result to D
    (note: you may get an error! ... think why and fix it. Recall matric manipulation in class!)
11. Create a complex number Z with absolute and real parts != 0
12. Show its real and imaginary parts as well as it’s absolute value
13. Multiply result D with the absolute value of Z and record it to C
14. Convert matrix B from a matrix to a string and overwrite B
15. Display a text on the screen: ‘Your Name is done with HW2‘
16. Organize your code: use each line from this assignment as a comment line before each step
17. Save all steps as a script in a .py file
18. Email your Github link to me including your .py file +
    screenshots of your running code no later than midnight on Saturday Jun.09.
